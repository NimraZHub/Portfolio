        I have hands-on experience in <b><u>software development and web design</u></b> through academic projects and internships. My work has involved building user-friendly interfaces using <b>HTML, C++, and Java, </b> as well as <b>developing backend logic in Java and working with MySQL databases</b>. I have contributed to team-based tasks, met deadlines, and enhanced systems for better performance and usability. With a strong focus on learning and problem-solving, I aim to apply my technical skills to real-world challenges in the field of education and technology.
